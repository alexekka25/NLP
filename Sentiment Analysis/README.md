## Project Overview

 This project is a sentiment analysis application that uses pre-trained deep learning models to classify text reviews as positive or negative. The application is built using:

* TensorFlow/Keras for model training (LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM models).

* Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

* Pre-trained embeddings (GloVe) for enhanced text representation.
Users can input text, select a preferred model, and receive predictions along with confidence scores through the web interface.

## Features

* Pre-trained Models: Utilize LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM for text classification.

* Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, users can:

**Select a model.**
**Enter custom text for sentiment prediction.**

* Real-Time Predictions: Sentiment analysis with confidence score.

# Technologies Used

* Python: Primary programming language.

* TensorFlow/Keras: For model development. 

* Streamlit: For building the web app.

* GloVe: Pre-trained embeddings for text representation.

* Jupyter Notebook: For data processing and model training.
