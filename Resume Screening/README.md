# Resume Screening App


This project is a Resume Screening application built using machine learning and heuristic approaches. The app extracts key information from resumes, such as:

`Category:`  Predicts the category of the resume (e.g., Data Science, Marketing)

`Email:` Extracts email addresses.

`LinkedIn:` Extracts LinkedIn profile links or mentions.

The app allows users to upload their resumes in PDF or Text format, and it processes the resumes to extract meaningful details
